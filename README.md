# Generalized Tic-Tac-Toe (MNK) Game Bot

This project is part of the Algorithms and Data Structures course at the University of Bologna. The goal of this project is to create a bot capable of playing the generalized version of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as MNK game. 
The bot is designed to explore parts of the game tree to decide the best move in the MNK game using also some heuristics.
